# AFTER: Optimized Node.js pipeline (6 minutes) - Generated by PipelineX
# Improvements:
# ✅ Dependency caching added (saves 3 min)
# ✅ Parallel execution (saves 12 min)
# ✅ Shallow clone (saves 40 sec)
# ✅ Path filtering (saves entire runs on docs changes)
# ✅ Docker layer caching (saves 5 min)
# ✅ Smart test selection (saves 6 min)
