# PipelineX v2.4.1 - Simulation UX & Output Polish

Small but practical release focused on developer ergonomics when running large simulations and parsing CLI output.

---

## ✨ What's New

### 1. Better `simulate` CLI Ergonomics
- New `--top-jobs <N>` flag to keep text output concise for large pipelines.
- New `--no-progress` flag for cleaner CI logs.

### 2. Long-Run Progress Feedback
- For long simulations in interactive terminals, PipelineX now renders progress and total execution time.

### 3. Stronger JSON Guidance
- Text output now clearly points to `--format json` for full machine-readable details (especially on large tables/findings).
